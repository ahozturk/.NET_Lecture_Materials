# YetGen Jump & Akbank Backend Program Lecture Materials
***YetGen Jump & Akbank Backend Education Program***'s Live Lecture Materials for Students

### Why I made this repository?

I made it for my students in the Backend Education Program. At the live lectures, I explain some topics, but sometimes students need to experience what they learned. For example: The topic is exception handling and I explained try-catch, exception classes, and so on... Then I send my students a project in this repo to apply exception handling. With this method, students can experience what they see in the lecture.
